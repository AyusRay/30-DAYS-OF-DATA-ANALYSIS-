# 30-DAYS-OF-DATA-ANALYSIS-
A public log of my journey to deepen my skills in Data Analysis over 30 days. Each day focuses on a different concept, tool, or project.



# Day 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation

Dataset: Titanic Demographic Data

Tools: Python, Pandas

Highlights: Handled missing values, feature transformations, and demographic breakdowns. Built a clean dataset ready for analysis.
✅ Key Insight: Survival chances varied strongly by gender and passenger class, highlighting the importance of preprocessing before modeling.


# Day 2: SQL & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Dataset: Swiggy Customer Analysis

Tools: SQL (MySQL)

Highlights: Wrote SQL queries to analyze customer ordering patterns, retention, and spending.
✅ Key Insight: High-frequency customers showed distinct order behaviors (preferred food categories & peak order times), valuable for retention strategies.


# Day 3: Text Analysis — Sentiment & Word Frequency

Dataset: Tweets with sentiment labels

Tools: Python, NLP

Highlights: Created text_length feature, applied text preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal), and analyzed positive vs. negative word frequencies.
✅ Key Insight: Positive tweets commonly used words like love, great, happy, while negative tweets featured bad, worst, problem. Clear patterns emerged even with simple NLP techniques.
